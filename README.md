# MNIST
MNIST classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and PyTorch.
The [MNIST dataset](yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of a very large set of handwritten digits (0, ..., 9).
This means it is a multiclass classification problem with 10 classes, wich is a good use case for a CNN.

# Setup
Code developed and tested on the following environment:
- windows 10
- python 3.9.19
- torch 1.13.1
- torchvision 0.14.1

To run the program it is enough to execute the main.py file. 
Either in any IDE like PyCharm or the terminal.
The MNIST dataset is downloaded automatically.
